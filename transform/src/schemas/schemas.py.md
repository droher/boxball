        Additional information.  This is a grab-bag of informational
              items that might not warrant a field on their own.  The field
              is alpha-numeric. Some items are represented by tokens such as:
                 "HTBF" -- home team batted first.
                 Note: if "HTBF" is specified it would be possible to see
                 something like "01002000x" in the visitor's line score.
              Changes in umpire positions during a game will also appear in
              this field.  These will be in the form:
                 umpchange,inning,umpPosition,umpid with the latter three
                 repeated for each umpire.
              These changes occur with umpire injuries, late arrival of
              umpires or changes from completion of suspended games. Details
              of suspended games are in field `completion_information`.

        on the originally scheduled date:

        postponed again, that date will be listed. In that case, there will be a second
        date for the date when the game was actually played, in this form: "20150428;
        20150528" For the note about a team folding, the team code is one of the
        standard Retrosheet team IDs. The same is true for the team played as note.
        Often, the two of these are combined in one field.
